## Recent Experiences

#### Deep Dive Coding at CNM Ingenuity

I started learning Java in January 2020.  I am proficient with IntelliJ IDE and Java SE 8+. I have experience with JUnit5 testing, relational database design using MySQL, RESTful services, Android ViewModel architecture incorporating ReactiveX tasks, and more, which you can examine below. I am also familiar with Scrum and Agile development methods.

Thanks to COVID-19, I got a crash course in remote work - I led my team in daily check-ins and planning calls, and managed our workflow by creating an Asana project to organize ideas and assign tasks.  Without my instructors in the next room to answer questions, I had to do a lot of independent research to fix bugs and work out implementations.

#### Verizon Wireless

The majority of my experience at Verizon is in tech support.  The Albuquerque call center was among the first to support complex services like international roaming, home/mobile internet devices, and network extenders.  I got my A+ certification to move up in Tech Support, and my Network+ because I found the technology fascinating.  Through these experiences, I became highly skilled at applying research, documentation and critical thinking to problems.  I also perfected the ability to communicate  between laypersons and technical experts. 

In my last 4 years at Verizon I went through leadership training and worked towards moving into a Supervisor or Trainer position.  Meanwhile, Verizon's tuition assistance program put me through a Master's in Adult Education with an emphasis in professional learning and development.  I discovered a surprisingly deep overlap between the subjects of learning and leading, which helped me motivate my teams to work harder *and* smarter, taking pride and initiative in their personal and professional growth.  The ADDIE training model\* guided me in creating and iteratively improving learner-focused training modules for everything from resolving usage disputes to building trust.

## Some personal information:

I am a multi-purpose nerd; I read voraciously, play Zoom D&D (it's actually Dungeon World right now), and I have a closet dedicated to board games.  Back when I had free time, my favorite hobbies were origami, chainmail and model building, with a sprinkling of video games and backpacking.  Now I have a son who I teach to make weird noises and not headbutt the dogs.

Aside from the finer points of reading, writing, and research, earning a BA in English taught me to pair creativity with critical thinking, to seek a balance of flexibility and structure, and to value new perspectives and experiences.

I didn't plan to work at a Verizon call center after college, or expect to do so for nine years, but I chose to stay for the opportunities to challenge myself.  My mission to not be bored at work led me to always look for new responsibilities and opportunities - I took every chance Verizon gave me to learn more, do more, and try new things. 
I approached every new piece of software and system update like an anatomy student, dissecting every screen, menu and setting.  I was bitter about it for months when a major update disabled the vast majority of our keyboard shortcuts, but I made up for it by writing batch files to open the handful of tools and programs I used.  

When Verizon made me a severance offer I couldn't refuse, I took a leap of faith that set me down at CNM Ingenuity.  Programming satisfies multiple passions for me: learning, technology, language, problem solving and building all come together. I put my strongest attributes - patience, persistence and attention to detail - to work daily, and plan to keep at it for as long as I can operate a keyboard.   

My short term goals are to get my Java certification (when testing centers reopen) and find a job that will support my ongoing development and let me support my family.
