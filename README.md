## A little bit about myself:

Aside from the finer points of reading, writing, and research, earning a BA in English taught me to pair creativity with critical thinking, to seek a balance between flexibility and structure, and to value new perspectives and experiences.

I didn't plan to work at a Verizon call center after college, or expect to do so for nine years, but I chose to stay for the opportunities to challenge myself.  I learned to communicate effectively, negotiate, manage conflict and build partnerships.  I made myself an expert on technical issues with every product we supported, from home Wi-Fi to international roaming, and every system I could access.

There was a surprising overlap between the lessons from my M.Ed courses and Verizon's leadership training. I learned how to motivate and support adult learners, and I got to practice with every combination of background, tenure and attitude across the center.

When Verizon made me a severance offer I couldn't refuse, I took a leap of faith that set me down at CNM Ingenuity.  Programming satisfies multiple passions for me: learning, technology, language, problem solving and building all come together. I put my strongest attributes - patience, persistence and attention to detail - to work daily, and plan to keep at it for as long as I can work a keyboard.  My short term goal is to graduate Deep Dive Coding, get my Java certification, and find a job that will support me continuing to learn, and let me support my family.

Back when I had free time, my favorite hobbies were origami and chainmail.  I hope to pick papers and pliers up again later this year.
