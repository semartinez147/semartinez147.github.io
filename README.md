## A little bit about myself:

Aside from the finer points of reading, writing, and research, earning a BA in English taught me to pair creativity with critical thinking, to seek a balance between flexibility and structure, and to value new perspectives and experiences.

I didn't plan to work at a Verizon call center after college, or expect to do so for nine years, but I chose to stay for the opportunities to challenge myself.  I learned to communicate effectively, negotiate, manage conflict and build partnerships.  I made myself an expert on technical issues with every product we supported, from home Wi-Fi to international roaming, and every system I could access.

There was a surprising overlap between the lessons from my M.Ed courses and Verizon's leadership training. I learned how to motivate and support adult learners, and I got to practice with every combination of background, tenure and attitude across the center.

I have used the ADDIE model for iterative training design & development to respond to rapidly changing business needs and individual learners. My efforts produced consistent and positive results in technical proficiency, critical and creative thinking, and interpersonal skills.

When Verizon made me a severance offer I couldn't refuse, I took a leap of faith that set me down at CNM Ingenuity.  Programming satisfies multiple passions for me: learning, technology, language, problem solving and building all come together. I put my strongest attributes - patience, persistence and attention to detail - to work daily, and plan to keep at it for as long as I can operate a keyboard.  

As a CNM Deep Dive graduate, I am proficient with IntelliJ IDE and Java SE 8+. I have experience with JUnit5 testing, relational database design using MySQL, RESTful services, Android ViewModel architecture incorporating ReactiveX tasks, and more, which you can examine below. I am familiar with Scrum and Agile development methods.

My short term goals are to get my Java certification (when testing centers reopen) and find a job that will support my ongoing development, and let me support my family.

Back when I had free time, my favorite hobbies were origami and chainmail.  I hope to pick papers and pliers up again later this year.
