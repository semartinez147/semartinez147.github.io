## Recent Experiences

#### Deep Dive Coding at CNM Ingenuity

I started learning Java in January 2020.  I was confident that I would at least enjoy coding - it puts a lot of the interests that drive my hobbies to work together - but I was surprised to find how engrossing the process is for me.  I picked the basics up very quickly, pushed myself with exercises on [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/java), and within a few weeks I was helping my classmates when our instructors were busy.  I organized weekly study sessions at the CNM library and created a collaborative learning community to support all of us.

Thanks to Deep Dive, I am proficient with IntelliJ IDE and Java SE 8+. I have experience with JUnit4 testing (and I'm learning JUnit5 on my own), relational database design using MySQL queries, RESTful services, Android ViewModel architecture incorporating ReactiveX tasks, and more, which you can examine below. I am also familiar with Scrum and Agile development methods.

COVID-19 gave me a crash course in remote work.  I led my team in daily check-ins and planning calls, and managed our workflow by creating an Asana project to organize ideas and assign tasks.  Without my instructors in the next room to answer questions, I did a lot of independent research to fix bugs and work out implementations.


#### Verizon Wireless

I worked at a Verizon Wireless call center from 2010 to 2018.  The majority of my experience is in tech support; the Albuquerque center was among the first to support complex services like international roaming, home/mobile internet devices, and network extenders (micro cell towers that connect to the Verizon network through a wired internet connection) on top of all the changes in cell phone technology over the last decade, and I made sure to familiarize myself with each new set of procedures, challenges and work-arounds as fast as possible.

I got my A+ certification to move up in Tech Support, and my Network+ because I was fascinated and Verizon was covering the cost.  I prided myself on the ability to guide even the least-confident and most tech-phobic customers through their router admin screens to configure DHCP reservations, port forwarding, occasionally even QoS and DMZ settings for network extenders - *without being able to see their screen* .  Through these experiences, I became highly skilled at applying research, documentation and critical thinking to problems.  I also perfected the ability to communicate  between laypersons and technical experts. 

In my last four years at Verizon I went through leadership training and worked towards a Supervisor or Trainer position.  I supplemented my training by using Verizon's tuition assistance program to earn a Master's in Adult Education, with an emphasis in professional learning and development.  I discovered a surprisingly deep overlap between the subjects of learning and leading, which helped me motivate my teams to work harder *and* smarter, taking pride and initiative in their personal and professional growth.  The ADDIE training model\* guided me in creating and iteratively improving learner-focused training modules for everything from resolving usage disputes to building trust.

## Some personal information:

I am a multi-purpose nerd; I read voraciously, play Zoom D&D (it's actually Dungeon World right now, and StarFinder in the near future), and I have a closet dedicated to board games.  Back when I had free time, my favorite hobbies were origami, chainmail and model building, with a sprinkling of video games and backpacking.  Now I have a son who I teach to make weird noises and not headbutt the dogs while I count down the days until he's big enough to take hiking.

Aside from the finer points of reading, writing, and research, earning a BA in English taught me to pair creativity with critical thinking, to seek a balance of flexibility and structure, and to value new perspectives and experiences.

I didn't plan to work at a Verizon call center after college, or expect to do so for nine years, but I chose to stay for the opportunities to challenge myself.  My mission to not be bored at work led me to always look for new responsibilities and opportunities - I took every chance Verizon gave me to learn more, do more, and try new things. 
I approached every new piece of software and system update like an anatomy student, dissecting every screen, menu and setting.  I was bitter about it for months when a major update disabled the vast majority of our keyboard shortcuts, but I made up for it by writing batch files to open the handful of tools and programs I used.  

When Verizon made me a severance offer I couldn't refuse, I took a leap of faith that set me down at CNM Ingenuity.  Programming satisfies multiple passions for me: learning, technology, language, problem solving and building all come together. I put my strongest attributes - patience, persistence and attention to detail - to work daily, and plan to keep at it for as long as I can operate a keyboard.   

My short term goals are to get my Java certification (when testing centers reopen) and find a job that will support my ongoing development and let me support my family.
